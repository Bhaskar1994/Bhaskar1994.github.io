title: Introduction

I'm a young aspiring scientific coder , i.e. I enjoy FORTRAN and C more than Python :) . I'm also a chess enthusiast and have enjoyed the game for more than 12 years. My current blitz rating on chess.com is above 1800(not a big thing to be honest, considering most players over there don't bother thinking much after barely messing up the opening). I'm currently in the process of developing a major open-source repository on aero-acoustics. Do check out [Project OSCAAR](https://github.com/Bhaskar1994/OSCAAR/blob/master/README.md) !!!
